# Quarter Moon Nights
Multisensory art club & social VR explorations.

This repository contains:
* Information about our multisensory XR art club projects.
* A template for your own projects if you would like to participate.

The [templates](data/2020/00-template-en-us) provide an example of what we are doing.
We are in the process of setting up each monthly prompt.

## Website
We have the domains for Quarter Moon Nights. We are working on the copy & scheduling the prompts for 2020-2021.

Currently, for each month we have:
* Scent Theme
* Topic
* Action
* Technology Challenge
* New group of collaborators and artists
* Monthly itinerary of events related to starting, developing and releasing projects.

Quarter Moon Nights is a project curated and developed by [Redbeak Studio](https://redbeakstudio.com).

Many thanks to the [Institute for Art & Olfaction](https://artandolfaction.com) for scent training, mentorship and giving us some frameworks to play and develop our multisensory approach.

If you are interested in "Olfactory Technologies", we have a new group, sprung up in the summer of 2020, called [Aroma Discord](https://redbeakstudio.com/posts/aroma-discord#intro), where you can meet other cross-disciplinary artists, researchers and technologists interested in exploring how we work in multisensory mediums. We are starting to grow our awareness of haptics, taste & flavors, touch, kinesthetics & welcome anyone interested in playing with that â€” as well as spatialized audio and virtual immersive art. We plan to have some sort of event in late 2021 & hopefully this project can help build community as we go.
