## Scheduling

### Phase Shifts
The lunar calendar & various zodiacs do not always line up perfectly, so our projects usually span 5-6 weeks total from warm up to cool down.

### New Moon
Warm up, prepare, create an intention for the project. Group email introductions for anyone participating.

### Quarter Moon, Waxing
Know what we are making that month, Art nights around time of Quarter Moon, setting up collaborative playlist, experimental play-testing.

### Full Moon
Being immersed in the project idea, excitement, instagram posts, exchanges, can have more art nights if there is momentum.

### Quarter Moon, Waning
Starting to close down, wrap up, finish.
Art nights to work on follow through.
Show & tells, smell shares, reviews, play-testing.
Lessons learned, acknowledgements, accomplishments.
Letting go!

### No meetings
We don’t schedule any meetings for the new or full moons because those are reserved for more personal creative time.
However, if people have friendly personal relationships, sometimes a lot of digestion or collaboration can happen at those times.

### Meetings
We do a few different meetings each month, but this depends on who participates and what we decide to do. Our project is totally voluntary & un-funded. We adapt based on our guest artists availability, energy and constraints.

### Full moon names, Holidays & Calendar systems
We also include moon names, seasonal holidays and other calendar events. Many holidays were originally tied to lunar or agricultural calendars & have rich stories. Holidays, calendar systems and reconnect with heritage for informing our creative work.

### Google Calendar & ICS
At the beginning of each cycle, we update a sharable calendar with the dates & also add any special holidays from anyone participating.
