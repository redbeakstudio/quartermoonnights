* Personal connection

## Scheduling
### New Moon
Warm up, prepare, create an intention for the project. Group email introductions for anyone participating.

### Quarter Moon, Waxing
Know what we are making that month, Art nights around time of Quarter Moon, setting up collaborative playlist, experimental play-testing.

### Full Moon
Being immersed in the project idea, excitement, instagram posts, exchanges, can have more art nights if there is momentum.

### Quarter Moon, Waning
Starting to close down, wrap up, finish. Art night to work on follow through. Before the new moon: show & tells: smell shares, reviews, play-testing, acknowledge accomplishments & failures, letting go!

### No meetings
We don’t schedule any meetings for the new or full moons because those are reserved for more personal creative time.
However, if people have friendly personal relationships, sometimes a lot of digestion or collaboration can happen.
