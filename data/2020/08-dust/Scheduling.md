## Scheduling
This is how the moon phases tend to work with our projects.

### Phase Shifts
The lunar calendar & various zodiacs do not always line up perfectly, so our projects usually span 5-6 weeks total from warm up to cool down.

### New Moon
Warm up, prepare, create an intention for the project. Group email introductions for anyone participating.

### Quarter Moon, Waxing
Know what we are making that month, Art nights around time of Quarter Moon, setting up collaborative playlist, experimental play-testing.

### Full Moon
Being immersed in the project idea, excitement, instagram posts, exchanges, can have more art nights if there is momentum.

### Quarter Moon, Waning
Starting to close down, wrap up, finish.
Art nights to work on follow through.
Show & tells, smell shares, reviews, play-testing.
Lessons learned, acknowledgements, accomplishments.
Letting go!
