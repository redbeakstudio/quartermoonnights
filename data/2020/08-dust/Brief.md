## Goals & Intentions
State the goal of the project for the month.

## Offerings & Distributions
Describe your ideal offering of your experiences & preferred distribution mediums.

## Team
Who is working on this (name, social media handles)

## Playlist & DJ rooms
Spotify or other playlists & sound experiences to share with other creators.

## Support
Venmo, donations, patreon page or other way to catch some coins to cover your costs & share with your team.
If you are creating works for sale, or want someone to get in touch for connections & inquires, this is a place to share that information. Be bold & it's okay to ask for financial support. Quarter Moon Nights is here to help you practice valuing your art & finding compensation for your hard work and contributions to culture.

## Set up & Viewing Instructions
An integral part of sharing multisensory experiences is setup.
If you are curious

## Experience Description
This is the pitch, logline, premise, quick description of the project.

## Scent
This is a section describing the scent project. For all Quarter Moon Nights projects, we focus and put scent, taste or touch first. This helps center our under-utilized senses and gives us a pathway to learning to collaborate, create and share multi-sensory art. With some ingenuity and resourcefulness, we can create unique experiences.

### Scent Brief
Description of the scent

### Materials
### Format
### Formula
### IFRA overages, allergens & environmental safety
### Sustainability plan

### Learn more about scent
We have a [resources](../Resources.md) page for more information about learning about scent, safety, communities, events and ways to experiencing creative works and multisensory experiences. Deep gratitude to the Institute for Art & Olfaction (https://artandolfaction.com) for opening the world of scent to so many & working so hard & smart to give us our own noses. If you like this, please join our online international 'olfactory tech collective study group' & stay tuned for an international series of smell-tech workshops, talks and play-dates this year.

## Aroma Discord & Mailing List
If you are interested in how scent & tech can work together, please join our Aroma Discord server.
Here is a link to request an invite. https://airtable.com/shrKiJES3nlqxHBXx. We check this periodically.
We created a form for sharing the link publicly & it also helps us meet you, help you get connected, and sign up for the mailing list for news about upcoming events & talks.

### Accessibility
Creating a scent experience can be as:
* ...simple as writing a description, or foraging materials from the yard or the kitchen.
* ...fun as a receiving questionable vial of creative perfumery delivered by mail.
* ...coordinated as perfumer's teaming up to share our work in group distributions, or organizing orders and experimental distributions.
* ...elaborate as a commercially produced and distributed fine fragrance, or future methods using exchanged capsules or other means.

### Safety v0.0.1
There is a lot of human history involved in our relationship with sharing molecules with each other (or not.)
We want to help share scents safely & responsibly. Over the next year, we will be providing examples of attempts to share scent safely, responsibly, sustainably. There are many people actively working on all aspects of these areas.

We have a [resources](../Resources.md) page for our 2020 findings & research.

### Interface
There are many interfaces and ways to manage the movement of scents. Part of this project is to show different methods in action and how they might be applied.

#### Accessibility
How the experiences (multisensory, too) can be made accessible to someone (recommended: offer in two methods)

## Set design
Notes on the design of the set & settings, mood, ambiance, vibe.

## Technology
Notes on how the project will be developed. We focus on accessible technologies for our projects (which are part of the pre-production or design & prototyping phase.) There are also all kinds of scent sharing hardwares and creative distribution businesses emerging. Maybe we can share smells after all.

## Interoperability & Cross Device Compatibility
What can you do to encourage that your multi-sensory experience can be experienced by a broad array of technology options? (We will show examples of this in our projects.)

## Challenges expected
What you are going to challenge yourself to try?

## Special Thanks & Making Art a Conversation
Who has helped you. (Note: you don't have to make this public on the internet, but it's important to take a moment to check in. Art is part of a conversation - what does the person helping you want to say?

## Failures & Letting Go
What didn't work?
What do you want to let go of, that was frustrating.

We use the lunar cycle and let go of our projects and ideas each month. The idea is that it's building creative muscle and ability to try and then let something go. So many of us beat ourselves up about not finishing or failing, and it makes art not any fun, full of technical misery, isolation, and dancing around speaking instead of being present in the world. We are creatives, too & we know.

So let it go. That's why we have a fresh prompt & the only boss of time here is the moon & yourself - or you and the shared dreams of the people you are creating something with.

## Accomplishments
After failing, it's helpful to make a list of what you did accomplish while you tried.
