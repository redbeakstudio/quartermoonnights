# Lunar Development

We are doing an experimental "Lunar Development Cycle" for our Quarter Moon Night projects.
So far, we like it & are continuning with it.

## Origin Story
This came to be after I spent 2019 building a relationship with the moon cycles. My new years resolution for 2019 was just to "get in sync with the moon." It took several months to find a way, but eventually I started to understand the pacing that comes with the phases of the moon, and that has been so helpful for my own creativity, that I am expanding it further.

As part of that, I hosted "art nights" every Quarter Moon with friends from comedy school, perfume school and animation meet ups. The pandemic has made art nights in my home impossible, and also the general shifts in the world cause me to want to take a more critical look at how time became standardized, and what that means for how we work, create and "produce" - and how that plays into ambition, time management, performance, survival and seeking approval - and how that interplays with our systems as well as what it means for how we adapt to pandemics, conflict and extreme weather events.

The moon is still stable.

There are companies planning to mine the moon, as well as Lunar Governance projects under way, but for the rest of our lives, it seems like we can count on the moon cycle & the rising sun - even if we might not be able to see it because of smoke, hurricanes and smog.

### Moon Basics
Every month, as the moon travels around the Earth, it is lit by the sun from an ever-changing angle.
* Every week, the moon is in a different phase.
* This repeats every month.
* The easiest way to figure this out is to go outside every night & start to observe the moon.
* Fun activity: see if you can figure out if the moon is perfectly at it's halfway point between the Full and New Moon.

### Moon Phases
New Moon
Waxing Moon (First Quarter)
Full Moon
Waning Moon (Last Quarter)

* Moon calendars: there are many artists offering beautiful lunar wall calendars each year, around the fall.

## Scheduling Creativity
In June 2020, I started up Quarter Moon Nights again, but adapted for the pandemic & as a way to also focus all the great creative energy that is coming up in a new olfactory tech community, and my own growth as a perfumer & creative technologist learning to create multisensory experiences for VR.

There is now a schedule of creative Prompts for 2020-2021, and I'm collaborating with friends and other olfactory artists to play and do experiments.

Our [Scheduling](Scheduling.md) document describes how the cycles connect to our creative, collaborative process for working, learning and creating art, technology and tools.

## Lunar Calendar Restoration
For this project, we are bringing the concept of energetic time management to a creative production cycle, and exploring how that informs sustainable, inclusive creative tech & community building. We are interested in how this harmonizes with our natural ups & downs.

We tend to be very far removed from these cycles and the thousands of years of conceptual wisdom that's connected to those cycles.

### Technology & Cycles
Since I am a web programmer by profession, the "Lunar Development Cycle" is something I'm exploring as an alternative to Agile, Waterfall and "MVP" development. Similarly, after moving to Hollywood, I notice that the film & TV industry also have rough and aggressive production schedules.

Meanwhile, creativity and everything interesting, social, healthy, sustainable come from a very different time cycle.

In order to offer insights on this, I'm continuning to spend time researching & exploring this. If you are interested in exploring this with me, please participate in this project.

## Calendar Restoration
In doing this research & experimentation, I've already noticed that there is a lot of cyclical value we can 'restore' in how we work and create.

Our months & week day names already are embedded with a conceptual framework that supports cyclical work.
We lost touch with agriculture in the last century.
Time was standardized in the late 19th century.
Mathematical astrology is basically already a giant clock.
Most holidays are astronomically or agriculturally timed already.
The United States is known for over-working, and also many companies try to explore work-life balance.

Our Gregorian calendar and Time & Date system may mask all of this useful information & allow us to schedule our lives relentlessly, stressfully, and often without acknowledging we are human and have ups & downs.

With the pandemic, our sense of time has changed.
Without our normal routines, it is a great time to experiment with time & improve upon our calendar systems.

## Moons, Mechanization, Menstruation & Data
Finally, as a strongly menstruating person who has monthly ups and downs - high levels of productivity and low-points of rest and digestion, I would like to offer this exploration to inform work and goal setting overall.

For my entire working life, all of my sick days and much of my PTO was used for period of ill-health connected with my own cycle, and I'm not alone. Some people have taken birth control pills, which changes the cyclical experience, and I've heard that even men can have some sort of monthly cycle. It would be interesting to look into our monthly cycles as well as our circadian (daily) rhythms.

Until recently, there was very little data about menstruation cycles (now, there are tracking apps and aggregated datasets, and actually studies with tons of data.) Gynecological health is generally under-funded, and many of the simple remedies developed over thousands of years are lost or poorly understood, and PMS/cramping and other disorders are what we are expected to deal with.

It wasn't until I spent years tracking my cycle (in my mid-30's) that I developed a very clear understanding of my own cycles, and these happen to have the same ups and downs as the moon cycles (though the cycles have different phase shifts, which keeps it interesting.) I have my own data now, and I already use it to plan how I work. This has been a very useful "productivity hack," and (more importantly), a means for building some work-life balance.

Importantly (and seemingly poorly understood in our industrialized society), *the cycle provides energy, as much as it takes energy*. 100 years after women were allowed to vote (in the United States, where I live), this is still a vague and mysterious secret terrain that is often hushed up or even taboo. Part of this surely has to do with the need to mask our cycles and conform to the requirements of industrialized labor in order to have alternative means of survival.

For this project, we are looking at the calendar and the cycle by creating monthly projects together. This builds data and shared understanding. I'm looking forward to seeing how this plays out after a year or so of observation.

I hope that it leds to more insights in how we are able to manage our time, energy and focus and that it leads to a better quality of life and healthy communities.

## Credits
In my "year of getting in sync with the moon", I came across some work that greatly influenced this thinking.

* Lunar athletics — Claire Gallagher has a very interesting project on "Lunar Athletics", using monthly cycles to time & balance workouts. https://www.thebodyastrologer.com/. (And it looks like she's writing a book about it.) This speaks to the fluctuations of energy that menstruating persons can feel and how that plays into exercise. I found her work while spending 2019 bringing an awareness "the Moon" into my life. Her idea that we are not designed to "go hardcore full force 100% of the time" is genius, and I've been observing this concept in creativity and work ever since.
* Wheel of the Year — A seasonal calendar, with holidays at the solstices, equinoxes and mid-points between those events. Aside from personal relationships and conversations, some folks who offer information through classes: an old friend, Allison Carr offered a course on the Wheel of the Year which helped me notice seasons (which led to noticing the moon cycles). Sharon Ramel offers many additional Udemy classes on the Wheel of the Year, and holidays and seasons. Living in LA, the culture of astrology is very strong, and it's nearly impossible to not be versed in astrology. J.W. Dotson also gave a great lecture at the IAO on the 7 Planetary scents, which showed how deeply the concept of time and planets informs art history.
* Holidays & Religions — Most of our holidays are based on astronomical events like eclipses and equinoxes, and the harvests that are derived from the energy provided by the sun. Any research into different religions usually reveals a wealth of insight that is often seasonally appropriate. This has also proven to be helpful for learning about heritage.
