### Scent Kit
#### For those new to scent & perfumery
we curate 'foraging lists' of accessible scent items. These come from your city, kitchen, or even your garbage.
There is an abundance of molecules to smell and notice.

#### For perfumery students & scent artists
We are perfumery students organizing this project.
We are super excited about having continuous prompts & playing with other creatives.
So far, these are the kinds of things we have done for our different projects:

* Tincture local materials & write notes on what we smell.
* Find out everything about a material, and compare notes.
* Write a scent brief based on the prompt & try a new formulation.
* If possible, share our formula to Open Sourcing Smell Culture's formula database (from IAO.)
* Design & experiment with scent interfaces.
* Create a sample scent to give to illustrators & concept artists (early in the process).
* Research how we can share our scent with small audiences.
* Understand and research the safety of whatever idea we have come up with.
* Create scavenger hunts for non-perfumers.
* Attend a 'smell-share' Zoom meeting.
* Play-test our scent in a social VR environment.
* Share ideas and work over instagram & group text.
* Describe a full multi-sensory experience.

### Scent-First
For multisensory collaborations, we work on the scent part of the experience first, and use that to inform the rest of the experience, including audio-visual content.

### Reduced-scope
We also reduce the scope of our premises. Multisensory experiences are more overwhelming to create, as well as to experience & share. 

Usually our ideas at the beginning of the month are too ambitious, even if scoped down.
By the end of the month, we have a more realistic scope & more gem-like project idea.

### Lots of non-precious projects
For visual art, there are projects like Inktober, or Urban Sketching. These social movements usually focus on prompts, and have a regular time basis that allows artists to sync up & learn from each other. Artists enjoy making a lot of non-precious work, as part of honing our craft. Similarly, improv groups create tons of material & this is how communication & story build up.

We are combining this idea & also applying it to VR development. VR has been so resource intensive & inaccessible that it's difficult to 'make sketches' and improvise in a playful environment. This is what we are working to cultivate with this project. So far, it seems to be working - we started as people who knew nothing about VR or design and after a couple of years, are more able to understand a creative process that marries sensory data with virtual experience design.

It also seems like technology artists can benefit from working in multidisciplinary environments along side writers, perfumers, musicians and other artists. That kind of community is difficult to find outside of university programs and innovation labs, so this project is about building out a structure & communication system to enable a culture of collaboration & art-making.

### Scent Interfaces

We design 'scent interfaces' for our projects.  

There are many kinds of scent interfaces.
The appropriate interface depends on the experience.

Here is a range of interfaces we have identified over the past couple of years of working on this project.

* Simple - a scent on your own skin, from a vial, spray or lotion.
* "Paper-based scent wearables" - what we use most for this project, pairs well with design-thinking & cardboard mockups. This includes items made from commonly available materials, adapted to support scent experimentation & play-testing. These use simple, fresh formulas. The materials may be foraged or scavenged, or be experimental formulas made with perfumery materials.

These all require special technical formulations (requiring an understanding of materials, safety & requiring a budget.)
* Ambient - room diffusers, incenses, olfactory candy, creative devices.
* Networked arduino projects — Through Aroma Discord (an olfactory tech community), we are working on building capacity to make tutorials & STEAM projects about making scent interfaces. Currently, we are learning about scent sensors & plan to develop public programming and educational materials on this topic as our research develops.
* Smart - off-the-shelf diffuser technologies.
* Digitized - Fully-scaled & digitized VR hardware with cartridge capsules containing nano-emulsions of scent delivered via subscription. (ex. Remniscent, Essence, AromaJoin, OVR Technology and others) - you can think of this like the "inkjet printer". Jas X Flowers has shared an open hardware list. These can have a high cost, and are best suited for established technology teams & production companies. Most artists & creatives are not necessarily going to be connected to those resources, so we are not focusing too hard on these devices until they are more available. Eventually our design-thinking approach will align with the digital front, but we are a few years from that & even still, there are not very many scent designers or UX specialists to inform how that works - or even to show new ideas & focus on impact & utility.
Note: the research & science fields are very interested in scent & VR for medical, psychological and historical research.
* Professional - What professional & supported artists use for their museum installations. For example, Sissel Tolaas created a scented wall paint for an installation, and there are many other elaborate and technical projects. (@TODO We need a list of artists for reference here. Also, Saskia Wilson Brown offers a class on experimental applications of scent, which surveys this whole topic.)

For these projects, we focus on the "paper-prototyping" equivalents that we might see in design-thinking projects or 'cardboard mockups' - and it turns out that's what actually scales & works better remotely, esp. since the higher tech options are more suited for commercial projects, but still need experience design processes in order to develop those ideas.

### Physical & Safety Notes
* Molecules move around in the air.
* Our noses habituate to scent after a couple of minutes.
* Scents have volatile compounds that reveal themselves along a timeline.
* Some aromatic molecules (of both natural and synthetic origin) can be allergens.
* VR is overwhelming and can produce motion sickness, as can scent.
* Pure aromatic ingredients should be viewed with caution, and never applied directly to your skin at full-strength.
* Not everyone has the same sense of smell, either because of anosmic (including Covid anosmia), biological factors, or simply because we rarely use our sense of smell. Some heavy molecules also vary from person to person, and can take some time to be able to smell.
* Taking classes with experienced perfumers, going on smell walks and smelling everything are good ways to develop your nose!

### Experience Setup
The final part is describing how to 'set up' for the experience.

Again, this can range from a simple 'onboarding' prompt for how to bring a scent (or taste, haptic experience) in the same way we've all learned to prepare for any other digital experience, or even to set up the "guardian" in VR. Most of this on-boarding takes place when we prepare for our monthly play-tests.
